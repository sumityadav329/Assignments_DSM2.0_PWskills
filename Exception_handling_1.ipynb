    "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "# A2.\n",
    "An Exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program due to unforeseen circumstances, such as invalid input, division by zero, accessing an index that doesn't exist in a list, and so on. Exceptions allow programs to handle errors gracefully by providing a mechanism to catch and handle these exceptional situations, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax Error**:\n",
    "   - Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the code violates the Python language grammar rules.\n",
    "   - These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing (or compilation) phase, before the program is executed.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, and the code needs to be corrected before it can be executed.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, missing colons in control structures, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception**:\n",
    "   - Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when an unexpected condition arises that disrupts the normal flow of execution.\n",
    "   - Exceptions are not detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase; they occur when a particular line of code is executed.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to take appropriate actions in response to the exceptional condition.\n",
    "   - Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError (division by zero), ValueError (invalid input), IndexError (list index out of range), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**syntax errors are detected during the code parsing phase and prevent the program from running, while exceptions occur during runtime and can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to handle unexpected situations and continue running.**"

    "## Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "### A2. When an exception is not handled in a program, it leads to the termination of the program's normal execution flow. Instead, the Python interpreter raises an unhandled exception, which displays an error message and a traceback showing the point where the exception occurred. This behavior can result in a program crash and an incomplete or unexpected output."

    "## Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "### A5.\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that you create by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Custom exceptions allow you to handle specific error scenarios in your code, making it more readable, maintainable, and informative. By creating custom exceptions, you can encapsulate the details of the error, provide meaningful error messages, and implement specialized error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why we need custom exceptions and an example to illustrate their use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Custom Exceptions:**\n",
    "1. **Clarity**: Custom exceptions make your code more clear and expressive by providing context-specific error handling. This makes it easier to understand the intent of the code and the reasons for raising an exception.\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Custom exceptions allow you to encapsulate error logic in a separate class, promoting modular and organized code. This makes your codebase more maintainable and reduces code duplication.\n",
    "3. **Custom Error Messages**: Custom exceptions allow you to define custom error messages that provide useful information about the error, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "4. **Specialized Handling**: With custom exceptions, you can catch specific error conditions in a more specialized manner, enabling different error handling strategies for different scenarios.\n",

    "**Example of Using Custom Exceptions:**\n",
