    "##### A2. The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Encapsulation:(*Data Secuirity) Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit called an object. It hides the internal details of an object and provides an interface to interact with it. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, ensuring that the internal state of an object is accessed and modified only through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: (*Reusability) Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. It supports the concept of hierarchical relationships between classes, where a subclass can inherit and extend the characteristics (attributes and methods) of its superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism:(*Extensibility)  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables code to be written that can work with objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method inherited from its superclass, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to exist in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: (*Data Hiding)  Abstraction involves focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It allows complex systems to be represented in a simplified manner. Abstraction in OOP refers to the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common behaviors and attributes without specifying their concrete implementation. It provides a high-level view of objects and enables modular design and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP provide a strong foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems. They promote code organization, reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making OOP a powerful paradigm for developing complex software applications."

    " `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object Context: When you define a method within a class, it operates on the specific instance of the class (object) that called the method. By using `self`, you can access the attributes and methods of that particular instance. It allows you to differentiate between different instances of the same class and perform actions specific to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attribute Access: The `self` parameter allows you to access and modify the object's attributes. Within a method, you can use `self.attribute_name` to refer to an attribute of the object and perform operations on it. This ensures that attribute assignments and retrievals are specific to the object calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Method Invocation: When you call a method on an instance of a class, the `self` parameter is automatically passed as the first argument. It allows the method to work with the specific instance of the class and manipulate its attributes or perform other actions.\n",
